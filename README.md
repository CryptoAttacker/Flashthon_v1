Each transaction requires a block for confirmation, and each block is created every ten minutes. To create a new transaction that is created with the software, a command to create a new block is given, and each block contains transactions, and these transactions include costs and fees. In the eyes of the Bitcoin network, these costs are the responsibility of the user who created the command. It is issued. 
How should this software pay the fee quickly and create the transactions of a block quickly? There is no way but to connect to the wallet. In this software, the hex private key is used (Bitcoin wallet private key) which is as follows:

`1d88aad6c0f7ccde7bca535696fab3843333c9e89f93de9f55ccb2792c42bd5d`

So, in the private key section, which is included at the beginning of the software, you must enter the hex private key. If you use those wallets that give you a private key in the form of WiF, you can use the[ CWF (Convertor Privatekey to WiF) ](https://github.com/Pymmdrza/CWF_Convertor-WIF/releases/tag/CWF.1.0.0.1) software to convert this private key into a hex. 
Wif Example : `KwDiBf89QgGbjEhKnhYvFh3n3mZDi4ynPtqMxRHcwPz84ebzAzGe`


- ⚠️ Make sure to do all the steps in order. After entering the private key in the first step, it is time to set, and with this the private key entered in the program's configuration is registered for a transaction. The picture below clearly shows what you should do in the first and second steps. After entering the private key of the wallet in the relevant section, you must press the set button.

- After entering the private key and pressing the set button, record a few seconds so that the software will automatically convert your private key to the wallet address (P2PKH , P2SH , P2WPKH, P2WSH) and after conversion, it will check the address of the wallets related to your private key. The wallet address approved and the default of Fleshton software address type **P2PKH** is . If your wallet server displays another address, be careful when entering the private key information. Or if your server displays another type of address like the other three digits, don't worry, you can use other servers with the same private key and use the **P2PKH** type address. As you can see in the picture, inventory has been taken from four related addresses and the report can be seen:

After entering the address and pressing the check button, wait for a few seconds until you see the confirmation message for registering the target address.


- In the next step, it is time to choose the type of target address, which is related to the exchange, or online wallet, or the wallet of betting sites. By activating each one, you can choose the corresponding option.
